    <p>This is a partly interactive prototype for a music-streaming app. Clicking on the image will lead you to the interactive view of the app in Figma.  <br /> 
       The app offers the possibility to share the streaming subscription, but have separate profiles. This allows you to get personal music recommendations <br />  and playlists without the other people's music taste interferring.  </p>
