    <p>My name is Jennelie Cohen. I'm 21 years old and from Stockholm, Sweden, but currently living in Jönköping. <br /> I chose to study NMD because I'm interested in working with people and digital creation, 
      <br />  so finding an intermediator between them in the form of for example UX seemed fun. </p>
    <p class="hobbies">My hobbies are:</p>
